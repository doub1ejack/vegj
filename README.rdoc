== Vegj - A Vegetable Growers Journal

Actually Vegj is more of an experiment in learning ruby than anything else.  
But the idea is that this would be a simple app that lets me record my gardening
activity.  It should know about my garden (size, zone, geographic location, etc)
and it should let me track important events (seeding, transplanting, pests, 
harvests, etc).
